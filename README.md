Building IOT Project
IOT Project Using PicsimLab Simulator.

CONFIGURATION: I'm using a Windows 11 with 8 gigs of RAM and I5 12TH GEN Processor.

IOT Project Requirements and their Download Links

Arduino IDE - for typing codes // https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Picsimlab simulator - virtual emulation of the real world IOT Project // https://rb.gy/dsbizr

null emulator - modem for emulation // https://lcgamboa.github.io/picsimlab_docs/0.8.8/Serial_Communication.html





I'll keep updating as the file continues.
MINI PROJECTS: 

IMPLEMENTATION: Blinking a LED with the help of Arduino IDE.

IMPLEMENTATION: Connecting a CLCD to the arduino board and printing Home automation system on it.

1st Project: This is a mini project that uses a LDR sensor to Blink a LED.

So, here's what happens:
LDR resistance is perpendicular to light, MORE LIGGHT = LESS RESISTANCE and vice versa
1. During night time, as the LDR resistance increases upto 1 ohm, it turns the LED on. 
2. During bright daylight, resistance  decreases (in theory to 0 ohm but in practical it is more than 0) and turns LED OFF. 

USE CASE: GARDEN LIGHTS IN RESPECTIVE TO SUNLIGHT.
